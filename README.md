## This is the publicly available codebase for the experiments shown in the article **Distributed Control of Partial Differential Equations Using Convolutional Reinforcement Learning**

To set up the project just download/clone this repository, activate the julia project, instantiate.
   ```
   julia> using Pkg
   julia> Pkg.activate("path/to/this/project")
   julia> Pkg.instantiate()
   ```

Afterwards you can run the experiments found in the subfolders of the `scripts` directory (the `setup` folders contain needed code but no experiments themselves).
